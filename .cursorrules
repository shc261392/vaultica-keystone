# Vaultica Keystone - Cursor/Copilot Rules

# Point your AI assistant to this file for brand-aligned code generation

## Project Context

This is the Vaultica Keystone repository - the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for the Vaultica brand.
Vaultica is an intelligent digital vault for people who capture everything but have no time to organize.

## Primary Reference Files

- Read `ai/brand-context.md` for complete brand understanding
- Read `ai/personality.md` for voice and tone guidelines  
- Read `ai/component-patterns.md` for UI component specifications

## Design Token Rules

### Color Usage

- NEVER use raw hex codes (#ffffff, #000000, etc.)
- ALWAYS use CSS variables from dist/theme.css
- Use semantic tokens (--vault-*) not primitive tokens (--color-primitive-*)
- Default to OKLCH color format for any new colors

### Semantic Color Mapping

```
Surface backgrounds: var(--vault-surface-primary/secondary/tertiary)
Text: var(--vault-text-primary/secondary/tertiary)
Borders: var(--vault-border-default/strong/subtle)
Accent/CTA: var(--vault-accent-default/hover/active)
Status: var(--vault-status-success/warning/critical)
```

### Typography

- Primary font: var(--font-family-primary) - Inter
- Monospace: var(--font-family-mono) - JetBrains Mono
- Use font-weight-semibold (600) or font-weight-bold (700) for emphasis
- Heavy weight (800) reserved for hero headlines

### Border Philosophy (Industrial Elegance)

- Default border: 2px (--border-width-default)
- Heavy/brutalist border: 3-4px (--border-width-thick/heavy)
- Borders should be VISIBLE and INTENTIONAL
- Cards and inputs should have strong borders

## Voice & Tone

- Stoic and Precise
- Confident, not boastful
- Use: "Encrypted," "Stable," "Verified," "Core," "Foundation"
- Avoid: "Cool," "Trendy," "Easy-peasy," "Awesome"

## Component Patterns

- Buttons: Heavy borders on secondary, solid bg on primary
- Cards: 2-3px borders, dark backgrounds
- Inputs: Thick focus borders, dark backgrounds
- Focus states: Always visible, use accent color

## Accessibility Requirements

- 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum (WCAG AA)
- Focus states must be clearly visible
- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum

## File Modification Rules

1. Token changes go in /tokens/*.json files
2. After modifying tokens, run: pnpm run build
3. Never edit /dist/ files directly
4. When this repo is used as submodule, remind to git pull in consumer project
